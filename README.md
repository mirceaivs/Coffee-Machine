# Coffee-Machine
 The "Coffee-Machine" project helped me learn basic Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. I got to practice creating classes, objects, methods, and inheritance to mimic how a coffee machine works. The project simulated a coffee machine where users could choose drinks, manage ingredients, and handle payments.
