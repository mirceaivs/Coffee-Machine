### Coffee Machine Project

The Coffee Machine project is a simple Java application designed to simulate the functionality of a coffee machine. It serves as a practical exercise in learning object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and basic Java functionalities.

#### Project Overview:

The Coffee Machine application allows users to interact with a virtual coffee machine, where they can:

- Select different types of coffee drinks (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino).
- Manage resources like water, milk, and coffee beans.
- Handle financial transactions for purchasing drinks.

#### Key Features:

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The project employs principles of OOP, including class design, inheritance, and encapsulation, to model the behavior of the coffee machine.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the coffee machine through a simple command-line interface, selecting drinks and managing resources.
- **Resource Management:** The application tracks the availability of ingredients (water, milk, coffee beans) and ensures they are used appropriately when making drinks.

#### Technologies Used:

- **Java:** The core programming language used for implementing the application logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Principles of OOP are employed throughout the project to create modular and maintainable code.

#### How to Run:

To run the Coffee Machine application locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Build and run the project using the IDE's tools.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the coffee machine and enjoy your virtual drinks!
